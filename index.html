        <h1><strong>How do I see the differences between HTML and CSS?</strong></h1>

        <ol>
            <li>What is the difference between the usage of <strong>HTML and CSS?</strong></li>
            
           <p> Html is used for the written content of a website and CSS is use for the graphical aspect, the layout and the content animation</p>
            
           <li> What is the newest version of <strong>HTML?</strong></li>
            
           <p> Version 5</p>
            
            <li>What are the top five most used <strong>HTML5 elements?</strong></li>
            
           <p> the top five most used HTML tags are the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> <code>p </code> tag</li>
                <li><code>li</code> tag</li>
                <li><code>div</code> tag</li>
                <li><code>h1 - h6</code> tag </li>
                <li><code> a </code> tag </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Have you checked out the<strong> HTML5 cheatsheet?</strong></li>
            
           <p> Yes I have, here's a <a href="https://www.wpkube.com/html5-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank"> link to the cheatsheet</a></p>
            
            <li>What is the difference between <strong>semantic and non-semantic elements</strong>?</li>
            
           <p> <em>Semantic elements</em> simply mean, elements with meaning. The reason being, there definition in the code tells the browser and the developer what they are supposed to do. Framing in simpler words, these elements describe the type of content they are supposed to contain.</p>

           <br>
            
           <p><em>Non-Semantic elements</em> don’t have any meaning. They don’t tell anything about the content they contain. They can be used with different attributes to mark up semantics common to a group.</p>
            
            <li>Why do we prefer using <strong>semantic elements?</strong></li>
            
           <p> Because they are more descriptive, self-explainatory and they refer to the type of their content </p>
            
            <li>Do all <strong>browsers</strong> support all of the newest <strong> HTML / CSS elements?</strong></li>
            
           <p> Not all browsers are supporting the latest HTML/CSS functionalities, they do not have the same compatibility level </p>
            
            <li>
                Test the following elements on <a href="https://caniuse.com" target="_blank">Can I Use</a>: svg, nav, code, form, datalist. Which browser version supports them and which
                do not?
            </li>

            <p>Chrome is the browser which has the better compatibility</p>
